## Assessment 2 - Market Garden Simulator

---

### Dev Entry 001:
#### 10/5/2021, 23:30 – 03:00
#### Work:
Wrote my code for the garden simulation (started and finished) and did a small amount of pseudocode

#### Challenges:
The Biggest issue was the naming convention and trying to make sure it's to the stranded but apart from that just 
not reading the task sheet properly and missing out a small component when the function was writen first

### Dev Entry 002:
#### 11/5/2021, 11:30 – 12:15
#### Work:
During this time I wrote the journal and did minor fixes to the code and pseudocode
#### Challenges: 
Trying to figure out what to write in the journal wa a challenge as it didn't take enough time to find a lot to 
write about

### Dev Entry 003:
#### 14/5/2021, 00:00 – 01:00
#### Work:
Bug fixes: 

| Bug      | Fix |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| There was an issue when the list of plants got to 0 it would automatically exit the program without final text. | Fixed by simplifying the code from a double while loop to a single loop, should've been done at the start. |
| When you waited a day and had 0 plants the program would crash. | Fixed by checking if plants was empty and jumping over all calculations for food and water | 

#### Challenges: 
Being very tired, it took me way to long to find the bug, but once found easy fix

### Dev Entry 004:
#### 21/5/2021, 20:00 – 22:00
#### Work:
Stress tested the program and checked for bugs, duplicate code, and converted the Mark down file to PDF ready for submission.
Changed very little about the code only added 2 comments to the file
