        <b>Site Title:</b> Training Zone <br><br>
        <b>Mission Statement:</b> The Training Zone web site is intended to increase revenue for Training Zone by
        promoting the services offered by the company and increasing new and repeat customers.<br><br>
        <b>Target Audience:</b> Local residents, mostly between the ages of 28 and 50 form the majority of our current
        audience (mature age job seekers), and this is who the site is aimed at.<br><br>
        <b>Success Evaluation:</b> Other advertising will be consistent for a period of 3 months (except for including
        the new web site), so that any increase in sales should be attributable to the site. At the end of this 3 month
        period (and during), the number of new customers will be counted and compared to the previous 3 months.<br><br>
